The model is defined as a sequential stack of layers.
It consists of three convolutional layers with ReLU activation followed by max-pooling layers.
The output from the convolutional layers is flattened and fed into two fully connected (Dense) layers with ReLU activation.
The output layer has softmax activation with the number of units equal to the number of classes in the dataset.
